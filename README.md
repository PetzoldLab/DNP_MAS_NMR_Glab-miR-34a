# Dataset
## NMR data description

The processed NMR data is provided as a zip. The folder descriptions are as follows:
1. Folders 1 and 2 are the solution NMR data of the miR-34a:SIRT1 duplex before and after lyophilisation
2. Folders 5, 6, 8 and 12 are DNP MAS NMR data for the duplex
3. Folders 14, 15, 17, 21 and 25 are DNP MAS NMR data for the ternary complex
4. Folders 34, 35, 36 and 37 are DNP MAS NMR data for the hairpin
5. Folders 40, 41, 47, 48 and 49 are DNP MAS NMR data for the binary complex

## MD simulation models

The three different starting structures are provided in the pdb format of the binary complex which were used for the molecular dynamics simulation
